# python-intro-course

This repository counts 6 notebooks. I try to introduce the basics of python programing.

* 01-gettingStarted.ipynb: deals with the basics, showing the different variable types.
* 02-functionAndClass.ipynb: this is a quick overview of function and class definition.
* 03-simpleDebugging.ipynb: here is a very simple example to practice the joy of debbuging.
* 04-usingGit.md: this text introduces you to the basic command of git, to start using version control system.
* 05-GIS.ipynb: this final example shows some of the endless capability of python in GIS. This example is also the occasion to see a typical code structure importing homebrewed module.
* 06-pandasExcercise.ipynb: this last notebook is an exercise, asking you to use pandas to read and analyse the data in `Data/listOfWildFire.csv`. This is the occasion to introduce the `geopandas` library. A solution is avalaible in `Data/solutionFrom06-pandasExcercise.py`
