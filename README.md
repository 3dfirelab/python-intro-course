# python-intro-course

This repository counts 6 notebooks. I try to introduce the basics of python programming.

* [`00-gettingStarted.ipynb`](./00-gettingStarted.ipynb): this first notebook show you how to setup your python environement.
* [01-basic.ipynb](01-basic.ipynb) deals with the basics. It shows the different variable types and the use of library as well as their installation.
* [`02-functionAndClass.ipynb`](02-functionAndClass.ipynb): this is a quick overview of function and class definition.
* [`03-simpleDebugging.ipynb`](03-simpleDebugging.ipynb): here is a very simple example to get introduced to debugging.
* [`04-usingGit.md`](04-usingGit.md): this fire is a text file that introduces you to the basic command of git, to start using version control system.
* [`05-GIS.ipynb`](05-GIS.ipynb): presents the 3 notebooks `05a-GIS-rasterio.ipynb`, `05b-GIS-geopandas.ipynb` and `05c-GIS-vector2raster.ipynb` that are examples of GIS data handling. These examples shows some of the capabilities of python in GIS. This is also the occasion to see a typical code structure importing home brewed module present in the `Src-tools/` directory.
* [`06-fdsreader.ipynb`](06-fdsreader.ipynb): shows an example loading data from FDS simulations using the `fdsreader` library.
*  [`projectList.md`](projectList.md): presents the projects of this course.
